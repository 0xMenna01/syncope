== Introduction

*Apache Syncope* is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in enterprise environments, implemented in 
Java EE technology and released under Apache 2.0 license. 

*Identity management* (or IdM) represents the joint result of business process and IT to manage user data on systems and 
applications. IdM involves considering user attributes, roles, resources and entitlements in trying to give a decent 
answer to the question bumping up every time in an IT administrator's mind:

[.text-center]
_Who has access to What, When, How, and Why?_ 

=== What is this Identity Management, anyway?

****
Account:: Computers work with records of data about persons. Such records contains technical information needed by the system for 
which the account is created and managed.
(Digital) Identity:: A representation of a set of claims made by one digital subject about itself. *It's you!*
****

Have you ever been hired by a company, entered an organization or just subscribed a new Google account?
Companies, organizations and cloud entities work with applications that need your data to function properly: 
username, password, e-mail, first name, surname, and more.

Who is going to feed such information? And what happens when you need to be enabled for more applications? And what if
you get promoted and acquire more rights on the applications you already had access to?
Most important, what happens when you quit or they gently let you go?

Shortly, Identity Management takes care of managing identity data throughout what is called the *Identity Lifecycle*.

.Users, groups and any objects
****
With Apache Syncope 2.0.0, the managed identities are not limited anymore to users and groups. New object types can be
defined so that any object's data can be managed through Syncope: workstations, printers, folders, sensors, services,
and so on. This positions Apache Syncope at best places for bringing Identity Management in the IoT world.

=== Bird's eye view on Architecture

*_Core_* is the central component, providing all services offered by Apache Syncope. +
It exposes a full-compliant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services[JAX-RS 2.0^] 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[RESTful^] interface which enables third-party applications,
written in any programming language, to consume IdM services.

 * *_Logic_* implements the overall business logic that can be triggered via REST services, and controls some additional
features (notifications, reports and audit over all)
 * *_Provisioning_* is delegated to manage the internal (via workflow) and external (via specific connectors) 
representation of users, groups and any objects. +
Being the crucial decision point for defining and enforcing the consistency and transformations between internal and
external data, this component needs often to be tailored on requirements of specific deployment. For this reason, besides
the all-Java default implementation that can be anyway extended, an http://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel^]-based 
implementation is also available as extension, which brings all the power of runtime changes and adaptation.
 * *_Workflow_*  is one of pluggable aspects: this lets every deployment choose the preferred engine
among provided - including the one based on http://www.activiti.org/[Activiti BPM^], the reference open source 
http://www.bpmn.org/[BPMN 2.0^] implementation - or define new, custom ones. 
 * *_Persistence_* manages all data (users, groups, attributes, resources, ...) at high level 
using a standard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API[JPA 2.0^] approach, persisting to an underlying 
database, referred as the *_Internal Storage_*. Consistency is ensured via the comprehensive
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html[transaction management^] 
provided by the Spring Framework. +
Globally, all this permits to scale up to million entities and at the same time allows great portability with no code 
changes: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MS SQL Server are fully supported deployment options.
 * *_Security_* defines a fine-grained set of entitlements which can be granted to administrators, thus allowing to
implement real delegated administration scenarios.

*_Admin UI_* is the web-based console for configuring and administering running deployments, with full support
for delegated administration.

*_End-user UI_* is the web-based application for self-registration, self-service and password reset.

*_CLI_* is the command-line application for interacting with Apache Syncope from scripts, particularly useful for 
system administrators.

Third-party applications are provided full access to IdM services by leveraging the REST interface, either via the 
Java _SyncopeClient_ library (at the basis of Admin UI, End-user UI and CLI) or plain HTTP calls.

.ConnId
****
The *_Provisioning_* layer relays on http://connid.tirasa.net[ConnId^]; ConnId is designed to separate the 
implementation of an application from the dependencies of the system that the application is attempting to connect to.

ConnId is the continuation of The Identity Connectors Framework (Sun ICF), a project that used to be part of market 
leader Sun IdM and has since been released by Sun Microsystems as an Open Source project. This makes the connectors layer
particularly reliable because most connectors have already been implemented in the framework and widely tested.

The new ConnId project, featuring contributors from several companies, provides all that is required nowadays for a 
modern Open Source project, including an Apache Maven driven build, artifacts and mailing lists. Additional connectors –
such as for SOAP, CSV, PowerShell and Active Directory – are also provided.
